│   │   ├── domain/                 # Domain layer (entities, services)
│   │   ├── presentation/           # UI layer (screens, widgets)
│   ├── user_profile/               # User profile management feature
│   │   ├── data/                   # Data layer (APIs, models)
│   │   ├── domain/                 # Domain layer (entities, services)
│   │   ├── presentation/           # UI layer (screens, widgets)
├── widgets/                        # Reusable widgets across the app
├── routes/                         # Routing configuration for navigation
├── localizations/                  # Localization files for app text (if needed)
```

### Explanation:

- **config/**: Contains general configuration files, constants, theme data.
- **core/**: Contains common logic or shared components like services (e.g., API, authentication), utilities, models, etc.
- **features/**: Organized by domain or feature (e.g., authentication, posts, applications), each feature has:
  - `data/`: Data models and data sources (e.g., API calls, local storage).
  - `domain/`: Entities, services, and domain logic.
  - `presentation/`: UI code including screens, views, and widgets specific to that feature.
- **widgets/**: Reusable components or custom widgets that can be used throughout the app.
- **routes/**: App navigation configuration (e.g., handling different screens).
- **localizations/**: Store language translations if you want to support multiple languages.

### **2. Jetpack Compose (Android) Folder Structure**

```plaintext
src/
├── main/
│   ├── java/                       # Java/Kotlin code
│   │   └── com/                    # Your app's package
│   │       ├── app/                 # Main app configuration
│   │       ├── authentication/      # Authentication feature
│   │       │   ├── data/            # Data layer (API, models)
│   │       │   ├── domain/          # Domain layer (entities, services)
│   │       │   ├── presentation/    # UI layer (screens, composables)
│   │       ├── posts/               # Posts feature (organizations post opportunities)
│   │       │   ├── data/            # Data layer (API, models)
│   │       │   ├── domain/          # Domain layer (entities, services)
│   │       │   ├── presentation/    # UI layer (screens, composables)
│   │       ├── applications/        # Applications feature (volunteers applying)
│   │       │   ├── data/            # Data layer (API, models)
│   │       │   ├── domain/          # Domain layer (entities, services)
│   │       │   ├── presentation/    # UI layer (screens, composables)
│   │       ├── userprofile/         # User profile management feature
│   │       │   ├── data/            # Data layer (API, models)
│   │       │   ├── domain/          # Domain layer (entities, services)
│   │       │   ├── presentation/    # UI layer (screens, composables)
│   ├── res/                         # Resource files like layouts, strings, etc.
│   ├── AndroidManifest.xml          # App configuration (permissions, components)
```

### Explanation:

- **authentication/**: Handles user registration, login, and role management.
  - `data/`: Manages network requests or local storage for authentication data.
  - `domain/`: Contains entities like `User`, and domain services for authentication.
  - `presentation/`: Composables for the authentication UI (sign-in, sign-up screens).
  
- **posts/**: Manages posts by organizations for volunteer opportunities.
  - `data/`: Contains API services to fetch and post opportunities.
  - `domain/`: Contains entities such as `Post` and services that interact with posts.
  - `presentation/`: Contains UI composables for listing, creating, and deleting posts.

- **applications/**: Handles volunteer applications to posts.
  - `data/`: Manages API requests to submit or retrieve applications.
  - `domain/`: Contains entities such as `Application` and logic for status changes.
  - `presentation/`: Contains UI composables for the application form and status.

- **userprofile/**: Manages the user profile, including volunteer information.
  - `data/`: Stores or fetches user profile data.
  - `domain/`: Contains user-related business logic.
  - `presentation/`: UI to display and edit user profile.

### **How to Start Coding:**

1. **Set Up Dependencies:**
   - For **Flutter**, set up dependencies for networking, state management (like `provider` or `riverpod`), and database/local storage.
   - For **Jetpack Compose**, set up dependencies for networking (e.g., `Retrofit` or `Ktor`), state management (`Jetpack ViewModel`), and local storage.

2. **Create Initial Screens:**
   - For Flutter and Jetpack Compose, create basic UI screens for authentication, displaying posts, and applying for posts.
   - Use `Navigator` (Flutter) or `NavController` (Jetpack Compose) for navigation.

3. **Build Domain Logic:**
   - Start by creating the core business logic and models (Entities, Services) for features like authentication and posts.
   - Implement repositories to fetch and manage data from APIs or local databases.

4. **Set Up Networking:**
   - Set up API services (e.g., `Dio` in Flutter or `Retrofit` in Jetpack Compose) to handle backend interactions like fetching posts, submitting applications, etc.

5. **Integrate State Management:**
   - For Flutter, use `Provider`, `Riverpod`, or `Bloc` to manage state.
   - In Jetpack Compose, use `ViewModel` and `State` to manage UI-related state.
