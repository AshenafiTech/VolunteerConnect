# DDD Architecture for Volunteer Connect App 
---

### **1. Identify the Domain**
The domain is about connecting **volunteers** with **organizations** based on **volunteer opportunities** posted by the organizations.

---

### **2. Define the Bounded Contexts**
Given the app’s functionality, we can break the system into a few **bounded contexts** to manage complexity:

- **Authentication Context**: Handles user login, registration, and roles (volunteers and organizations).
- **Post Management Context**: Handles the creation, viewing, and deletion of posts by organizations.
- **Application Management Context**: Handles volunteer applications to posts, including submission forms and status tracking.
- **User Profile Context**: Manages user profiles, including personal details and application history.

---

### **3. Entities and Value Objects**

#### **Entities:**
- **User**: Represents a volunteer or an organization.  
  - Attributes: `userId`, `name`, `email`, `role` (volunteer or organization), `profileDetails` (for volunteers).
  
- **Post**: Represents an opportunity posted by an organization.  
  - Attributes: `postId`, `title`, `description`, `organizationId`, `status`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.

- **Application**: Represents a volunteer’s application to a specific post.  
  - Attributes: `applicationId`, `volunteerId`, `postId`, `status`, `submittedAt`.

#### **Value Objects:**
- **PostDetails**: Contains the specific content of a post, like `title`, `description`, and `requirements`.
  
- **UserProfile**: Holds specific details for volunteers, such as `skills`, `experience`, and `location`.

- **ApplicationForm**: The structure of the form a volunteer fills out when applying, such as `name`, `skills`, `experience`, and `coverLetter`.

---

### **4. Aggregates**

- **User Aggregate**: The user aggregate will include user details and related actions like profile creation, role assignment (volunteer/organization), and authentication.
  
- **Post Aggregate**: The post aggregate will handle the creation, modification, and deletion of posts. It also ensures that only authorized users (organizations) can create and manage posts.

- **Application Aggregate**: The application aggregate will track a volunteer's application, including status updates (e.g., applied, in review, accepted, rejected).

---

### **5. Services**

- **AuthenticationService**: Handles user authentication and registration. This service will verify credentials, create tokens, and assign roles to users.
  
- **PostService**: Handles post-related logic such as creation, updating, deleting, and retrieving posts for organizations and volunteers.

- **ApplicationService**: Manages the submission of volunteer applications, updates on the status of applications, and interactions between volunteers and organizations.

- **NotificationService**: Sends notifications to users when their post is interacted with, such as when a volunteer applies or when a post is deleted.

---

### **6. Repositories**

- **UserRepository**: Manages user storage and retrieval, based on `userId` or `email`.

- **PostRepository**: Manages post creation, deletion, and retrieval by the organization or postId.

- **ApplicationRepository**: Tracks volunteer applications and retrieves them based on `applicationId`, `postId`, or `volunteerId`.

---

### **7. Domain Events**

Domain events represent actions or changes within the system that need to be communicated or acted upon.

- **PostCreated**: When an organization posts a new opportunity.
  
- **ApplicationSubmitted**: When a volunteer submits an application for a post.
  
- **PostDeleted**: When an organization deletes a post.

- **ApplicationStatusUpdated**: When the status of an application changes (e.g., accepted, rejected).

---

### **8. Use Cases / Application Layer**

The **application layer** handles interactions between the user interface and the domain layer:

- **User Registration & Authentication**: Volunteers and organizations can sign up and authenticate.
- **Create Post**: Organizations can create new volunteer opportunities and manage them.
- **View Posts**: Volunteers can browse available posts.
- **Apply for Post**: Volunteers submit application forms to posts.
- **Delete Post**: Organizations can delete posts they’ve made.

---

### **9. Interaction Flows**

- **Volunteer Applying to a Post**:
  - A volunteer views a post created by an organization.
  - The volunteer fills out an **application form** and submits it.
  - The system creates an **Application** entity, linked to the volunteer and the post.
  - The organization is notified about the new application.

- **Organization Creating or Deleting a Post**:
  - The organization creates a new post, which triggers the creation of a **Post** entity.
  - The system ensures that only organizations can create, update, or delete posts (role-based access).

---

### **10. Example of Entity Relationships**
- **User** (volunteer) can submit many **Applications**.
- **Organization** can create many **Posts**.
- **Post** can have many **Applications**.
